# Binary-Game in MIPS Assembly

## Project Overview

This program allows users to interact and learn more about binary-to-decimal conversion
and decimal-to-binary conversion. The program randomly generates 8-bit binary and decimal
integers until 255, and asks the user to convert to the opposite type. If the user answers the
question correctly, the program will tell them it is correct; otherwise, the program will end and
let the user know what the correct answer is. The game has 10 levels with each level having a
corresponding amount of random conversion questions. In this game, the user doesnâ€™t lose or
gain any points, but they get the chance to do a lot of conversion questions! The game will end if
the user is incorrect or if the user passes all 10 levels, which in this instance they win the game.    

## Run the program

1. Download Java and go to VS Code

2. Install the MARScode extension and go to the main.asm file.

3. Press Ctrl + Shift + P and select "MARS: Assemble and run". Enjoy the game!
